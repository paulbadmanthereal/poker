# poker
a basic python poker script.


card values: 
Ace': 1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7,
    '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'Jack': 11, 'Queen': 12, 'King': 13

like the other gambling repositories i have, it's gonna have coins. but this one, this one has an AI for you to fight.
now it is very basic since yk i am horrible at scripting 
BUT it does work (kinda)
since the 'testing' phase is just me gambling for 5 minutes btw lmao.
ai difficulty 1-10 you start with 1000 coins, go google how to play poker cause i am ASS at explaining
